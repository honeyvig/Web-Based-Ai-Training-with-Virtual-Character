# Web-Based-Ai-Training-with-Virtual-Character
An immersive learning experience, for laptop and tablet. Teacher can create scenarios with the help of AI. Students can practice these scenarios, interacting with a virtual avatar through speech, in a 3D space. The application (AI) will provide immediate full feedback on performance of the student. This includes feedback on the communication skills as well as feedback on the actual content of the conversation and the questions asked.
Student can also ask virtual avatar to show some movements, relevant for diagnoses.
Scoring system.
History and progress available for student and teacher.
Current scope: 3 modules for medical.
Potential for large scalable platform.
It is very important that the information provided by the AI is reliable, based on the factual information provided for scenarios by the teacher and avoids halucination.
Information should also be contained.
Highly realistic avatar interaction.
------------------------
Creating a Python application that supports an immersive learning experience with AI, 3D avatars, speech interaction, and performance feedback involves several advanced components, including AI-driven natural language processing (NLP), 3D graphics, speech recognition, and feedback generation.

Here's a breakdown of the key components for such an application and a conceptual implementation plan using Python and various relevant libraries:
Key Features & Components:

    Speech Interaction: Students can interact with the virtual avatar via speech.
        Speech-to-Text: Converts the student's speech into text.
        Text-to-Speech: Converts the avatar’s responses back into speech.

    3D Avatar Creation: An avatar that responds realistically to the student's inputs.
        This can be achieved using a 3D engine like Unity or Unreal Engine that integrates with Python via PyGame or OpenCV for processing.

    AI Feedback Generation: AI analyzes the student's input to provide feedback on communication and content.
        Feedback should focus on clarity, correctness, and engagement.
        Use NLP models (like GPT, BERT, or a custom medical domain model) to evaluate responses and ask follow-up questions.

    Scoring System: A real-time scoring system based on the student’s performance in communication and content.
        This will likely involve scoring based on speech analysis and correct medical information retrieval.

    History and Progress: The system tracks progress for both the teacher and the student.
        Store interaction data in a database and present progress charts.

Conceptual Code Implementation

We'll break the code down into sections based on the functionality:

    Speech Recognition: Use speech_recognition to capture and convert student speech to text.
    AI Processing and Feedback: Integrate with an NLP model (like GPT-4 or a custom medical model) for content-based analysis and feedback.
    3D Avatar Integration: Use Unity or similar engines with Python integration for the avatar and movements.
    Text-to-Speech: Use pyttsx3 or gTTS to convert text feedback into speech.
    Scoring System: Implement a simple scoring system based on the accuracy of the student's answers.

Example Code:

Below is a simplified Python script that sets up the speech recognition and AI-based feedback generation. This code doesn't handle the 3D avatar or real-time interaction, but gives an idea of how you can structure the backend for feedback.
Install Required Libraries:

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3 openai

    Speech Recognition and Feedback Generation Example:

import speech_recognition as sr
import pyttsx3
import openai

# Initialize speech-to-text engine
recognizer = sr.Recognizer()

# Initialize text-to-speech engine
engine = pyttsx3.init()

# Set OpenAI GPT key for feedback (GPT-4 or another model)
openai.api_key = "your-openai-api-key"

# Function to process feedback using GPT
def generate_feedback(student_input):
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        model="text-davinci-003",  # You can choose GPT-4 or a custom model here
        prompt=f"Provide feedback on this medical scenario response: {student_input}. Ensure the feedback is factual, accurate, and encourages improvement.",
        temperature=0.5,
        max_tokens=200
    )
    feedback = response.choices[0].text.strip()
    return feedback

# Function for speech recognition
def listen_for_input():
    with sr.Microphone() as source:
        print("Listening for student's input...")
        recognizer.adjust_for_ambient_noise(source)
        audio = recognizer.listen(source)
    
    try:
        print("Recognizing speech...")
        student_input = recognizer.recognize_google(audio)
        print(f"Student said: {student_input}")
        return student_input
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print("Sorry, I didn't understand that.")
        return None
    except sr.RequestError:
        print("Could not request results from Google Speech Recognition service.")
        return None

# Function to provide audio feedback
def provide_audio_feedback(feedback):
    engine.say(feedback)
    engine.runAndWait()

# Function to score the student's input (basic example based on keywords)
def score_input(student_input):
    # This is a basic scoring system based on keywords; for advanced use, NLP-based scoring would be needed
    score = 0
    keywords = ["treatment", "symptoms", "diagnosis", "procedure"]
    for word in keywords:
        if word in student_input.lower():
            score += 10  # Award 10 points for each relevant keyword
    return score

def main():
    # Listen for input from student
    student_input = listen_for_input()
    
    if student_input:
        # Generate feedback from AI model
        feedback = generate_feedback(student_input)
        print(f"AI Feedback: {feedback}")
        
        # Provide feedback to the student via audio
        provide_audio_feedback(feedback)
        
        # Score the student's input
        score = score_input(student_input)
        print(f"Score: {score}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

Explanation:

    Speech Recognition (speech_recognition library):
        The listen_for_input() function listens for speech and converts it to text using Google’s speech recognition API.

    AI Feedback Generation (openai library):
        We use GPT-3 (or GPT-4 if available) via the OpenAI API to generate feedback for the student’s input. The feedback is based on the context of medical scenarios, and you can adjust the prompt accordingly for different learning modules.

    Text-to-Speech Feedback (pyttsx3):
        The provide_audio_feedback() function uses the pyttsx3 library to provide spoken feedback, allowing the student to hear the AI’s suggestions.

    Scoring:
        A basic scoring system is implemented to assign points for keywords. This can be extended by using NLP techniques to better evaluate the responses based on relevance, tone, and correctness.

3D Avatar Integration:

    3D Engine: For creating the virtual avatar and integrating with Python, you would typically use a game engine like Unity or Unreal Engine. Unity has Python bindings, so you can integrate Python scripts for controlling avatars and managing AI-driven interactions.

        In Unity, you can use C# to control the avatar's movements and reactions based on Python inputs, or alternatively, use Unity's built-in ML-Agents toolkit to integrate machine learning models directly within the Unity environment.

        You would connect Python with Unity using Python for Unity or via a REST API, where Python sends commands to Unity, and Unity renders and interacts with the user.

Real-Time Feedback:

For real-time feedback and scoring, you can use AI tools like BERT or GPT-3/4 to process the student’s answers and provide scoring based on both medical knowledge and communication skills (e.g., clarity, engagement).

You can further enhance this system by:

    Implementing Natural Language Understanding (NLU) techniques to evaluate medical accuracy.
    Using speech analysis tools to assess tone, confidence, and other communication aspects.
    Storing and tracking student progress in a database like PostgreSQL or Firebase.

Scalability:

For a large platform, this architecture can be expanded by:

    Using cloud services like AWS or Google Cloud for handling more complex AI models.
    Scaling the system for multi-user interactions with simultaneous feedback.
    Adding additional modules for various medical scenarios and even other subjects.

Conclusion:

The outlined Python code provides a starting point for integrating speech recognition, AI-driven feedback, and scoring for an immersive learning experience. Combining this with 3D avatar interaction in Unity or another platform will create the foundation for a robust and scalable learning system for medical students (or other fields).
